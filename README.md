# Fractal Fabricator

This is a C++ solution to the programming challenge found here: <br>

<br>
I originally created this Oct of 2016, at the time I was experimenting with SFML and decided to use that to solve this challenge. I kind of forgot about it for a while but I thought it was a neat project and decided to copy it over into visual studio 2022, remove most of the comments (I had every line commented originally since I had no idea what I was doing) and update the SFML libraries from 2.2 to 2.5.1. My current plan for this is to try and speed it up a bit and allow for changing the function parameters that generate the fractal rather than keeping them hardcoded as they are  currently. I'd like to try and compile it to webassembly and create a web app using Angular that would allow people to generate and download desktop wallpapers with it. <br>
<br>
Fair warning, I don't usually use C++ anymore and mostly use C# these days so my C++ code may not follow best practices. Suggestions are greatly appreciated if anyone stumbles upon this. <br>
